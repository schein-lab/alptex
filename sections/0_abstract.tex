This paper provides an illustrative example of a comprehensive \LaTeX{} project template for our lab. It presents a modular structure that separates content into logical sections, facilitates bibliography management, and provides consistent formatting across documents. This approach reduces setup time for new projects and promotes best practices in document organization. This descends from the legendary template known informally as \texttt{alptex}.
